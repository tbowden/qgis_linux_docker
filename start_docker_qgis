# Not yet working. Warning: Mounts entire home dir to docker container.
# ** Don't do this if you are running SeLinux**. You will completely bork
# your system (according to the Docker ref docs on bind mounts).

# Pass in the user id & gid of the user starting the container. The user name
# won't be known inside the Docker container, but otherwise permissions work.

# Current issues arrise with /run/user/<uid> folder ($XDG_RUNTIME_DIR), but
# working on it... Not sure yet if making it rw will completely bork my current
# login session...

# The Docker image referred to isn't on Docker Hub- assumed to be built locally
# There is no [ENTRYPOINT] or [CMD] in the Dockerfile until things get working...

# Detaches from terminal (docker run -d), so use 'docker exec -it qgis_experimental /bin/bash'
# to connect to it after starting
